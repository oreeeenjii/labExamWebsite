        <p><br>The U.P.â€“Ayala Land TechnoHub is an information technology hub jointly <br>
            developed by the University of the Philippines Diliman and property <br>
            developer Ayala Land. It is located in Commonwealth Avenue, Barangay U.P. Campus,<br>
             Quezon City. It occupies 20 hectares (49 acres) within the 37.5 hectares<br>
              (93 acres) of the U.P. North Science and Technology Park.</p>

        <div class = "textBox"> Business Activities</div>
        
        <p>
            The entire development was listed as an approved IT Park by the Philippine <br>
            Economic Zone Authority in February 2009. This status makes export-oriented <br>
            companies located therein eligible for temporary tax holiday, permanent reduced <br>
            rate of corporate income tax, and other incentives. IBM announced in February<br>
            2009 that it would open an Innovation Center at the park, its second in Southeast <br>
            Asia after the one located in Malaysia. Convergys also inaugurated its contact <br>
            center at TechnoHub in April 2009, along with two others simultaneously opened at <br>
            Nuvali TechnoHub in Santa Rosa, Laguna and Cebu IT Park in Cebu City.

            The land where the TechnoHub now stands is owned by the University of the Philippines Diliman.<br>
            Sometime in October 2006, the land was leased to Ayala Land by the state university so an <br>
            information technology hub could be developed. In that month, Ayala Land announced that it <br>
            would invest P6 billion over the following five to ten years to develop the Commonwealth Avenue<br>
             property. Then-Quezon City mayor Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. signed an order in December 2006 <br>
             adjusting the zoning classification of part of UP Diliman so that the project could legally proceed.<br>
             <br>
            The TechnoHub is the second U.P.-Ayala joint project, the first being the U.P. South Technopark <br>
            along C.P. Garcia and Katipunan Avenues; it is then followed by collaborations on Katipunan Avenue <br>
            south of the UP Diliman campus. Critics have charged that the site represents stealth <br>
            privatization of part of the university and a gateway for private sector "vultures" to establish a <br>
            foothold in the non-commercial university. Seven U.P. students were arrested for raising protests <br>
            to this end during the hub's inauguration on November 22, 2008 they were released without charges.<br>
            <br>
            The first batch of tenants began moving into the technology park in August 2008.[1] In October 2008, <br>
            Ayala announced that ten startups would move into the northern technology park, in comparison to the <br>
            nine already located in its southern counterpart.<br>
            <br>
            In July 2009, Ayala and UP Diliman's opened a third collaboration, the DOST-PEZA Open Technology <br>
            Business Incubator, at Katipunan Avenue; the new incubator planned to host companies focused on cloud <br>
            computing and open-source software development.<br>
            <br>
            In 2014, the Quezon City local government planned to auction off the TechnoHub property due to the <br>
            University of the Philippines alleged failure to pay it P117 million worth of real estate tax. While<br> 
            under the law, educational institutions are exempt from paying real estate tax, the Quezon City <br>
            Treasury interprets that the property became taxable the moment the university leased it to a private <br>
            firm. The auction was called off by the Supreme Court through a temporary restraining order.<br>
